# Anti Adversarial Networks

This is a WIP package for anti-adversarial network exploration as part of a thesis in Mathematics at the University of Waterloo.

# Installation

This package is not hosted on PyPi. It can be installed localled by, assuming `cwd` is the anti adversarial project root: 

`pip install -e /src/adversiarial`

the `-e` allows for live-editing of the package, if changing during experimentation. 

This package is **specifically** not publicly available on PyPi or other package hosting repositories. If you have somehow found this and are not involved in the project, kindly do not use anything herein (and maybe notify the authors) - there is no reason to believe that this code is safe to use. 

## Setup.py vs setup.cfg

As this module is under constant testing, it is intended for installation with `-e` for pip. Pip does not yet support an editable option for `setup.cfg`. 

# Usage

# Requirements

`PYTHON`: at least 3.9 or greater is required.
